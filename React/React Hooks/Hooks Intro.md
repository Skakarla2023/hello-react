### Hooks:

- Hooks are special functions in React that let us use states and other React features inside a functional component without using Class Component.

### LifeCycle:

- A lifecycle in React is the series of stages a component goes through – mounting, updating, and unmounting – and we can run code during these stages.”

### State:

- A state is a special variable inside a component that can change over time and the component re-renders to show the updated value.
