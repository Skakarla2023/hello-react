### Hooks:

- Hooks are special functions in React that let us use states and other React features inside a functional component without using Class Component.

### LifeCycle:

- A lifecycle in React is the series of stages a component goes through – mounting, updating, and unmounting – and we can run code during these stages.”

### State:

- A state is a special variable inside a component that can change over time and the component re-renders to show the updated value.


## React Hooks


#### “useState is a React Hook that lets you add and manage state (dynamic values) inside functional components, and re-renders the UI whenever the state changes.”

#### “useEffect is a React Hook that lets you run side effects (like data fetching or DOM updates) in functional components, with a dependency array controlling when the effect should run.”

#### "useContext is a React hook that lets functional components directly access shared context data, avoiding prop drilling."
