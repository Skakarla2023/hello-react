# Step-by-Step Process of Rendering React Components

Create components in separate files (Header, Footer, etc.).

Combine components inside App.js to make the main app.

index.html has a <div id="root"></div> as a placeholder for the app.

index.js finds this root div and tells React: “Render <App /> here.”

React renders all components from App.js into the root div, and the webpage displays them.
